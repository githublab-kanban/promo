**Kopa.io is an upcoming lightweight issue collaboration board.**

With kopa.io you will be able to manage issues from [GitHub](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) and many more on a [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)-like board.

---

You no longer scroll through lists of issues, but you rather organize issues presented as cards on a board, moving them from one column to the next until they are done.

Store any project or issue in your favorites to get instant access to it.
